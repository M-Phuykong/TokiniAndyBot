TIL TIL it also means train platform
It's the small victories
a
Bot test I'm guessing
it's working!
heh
Question: meals from a train station, are they supposed to be heated and eaten later or are they eaten on the train after being heated or are they eaten cold?
Currently at Kyoto Station waiting for the Shinkansen
really it depends on what they are selling, some foods are better hot but intentionally cold just to be more convenient for both the seller and customer
i’d say eaten on the train after being heated
thats just my experience though
Are you buying one of those train bentos?
the bentos were so good uwajimaya is a meer 10 minutes from the seattle amtrak station Sounds good. If there's a way to heat it up before you hop on the train, might be worth it.
Kinda already on it
Nice
mmmm
Not seeing any heating instruction
that sounds very good
<@775157265451581450>  here is the site (posting it here in case ppl want to look)
https://www.marugoto-online.jp/info/
this is what we use in my class
right now im at the Pre-Intermediate (A2/B1) book
Oh sweet! thanks!
its also good for ppl who want a good study tool
since its all in Japanese you force yourself
that's nice for my level now, I feel like I need to push myself a bit
its what ppl call "immersion" but more like being in your target language
liek taking a weekend to read a book , or play a game
yeah makes me sweat sometimes, its not too hard and not to easy
I'm looking forward to trying it!
and its not too expensive
so its worth imo
it'll be nice to have something new too
you can also look in <#1063983674669936760>  I try to post things in there thats a little harder for ppl to do
also https://www.marugoto.org/en/e-learning/
haha I am actually in the process of typing up a response to the homework! I enjoy the challenge
er - https://minato-jf.jp/ that
Oh cool! I will check it out
yeah it's great and free
(subsidized by the japanese foundation)
Im on lesson 3, the food chapter lol
so far my fav ones (my teacher knows I like to cook)
One of my favorite things about learning about Japan is the cooking
I frequent this little Japanese market, the lady is so nice lol
I liek to cook, in general, since Im a kid
dad is also a chef
so I spent a lot of times in the kitchen
if I can feed ppl, it makes me happy
I follow a couple of japanese cooking channels on youtube and they are really fun
yeah i cook a lot of japanese food
asian broadly reallhy
I would like to branch into Korean food
this week i am taking a week off from that continent's food
cooking wise
lol - i have korean leftovers that i need to eat for lunch tomorrow
lucky!
tomorrow I am making gemista (stuffed veg) and I think maybe a fish soup if I can get good fish
oooooo share pics!
That sounds good!
https://kimchimari.com/ and aaron and claire (the blog and the youtube channel) and https://www.koreanbapsang.com/ are my favorites for korean
omg SWEET thank you!!
(yes i am excluding the most popular korean food blog/youtube channel - she's great, but i like these ones better)
np
and then if you have a subscription to the nytimes, eric kim has a number of good recipes
(nytime's cooking website is gold)
ohhh good to know!
it's one of the reasons i keep my subscription with them
(i appear to be locked into their student pricing)
i mean i also read the nytimes and play the crossword
I do the mini every morning!
but their cooking website is underrated - it is *very* good
yes!
Great! How about you ?
I’m also good! Had a great weekend so far! i'm okay - just got back from REI
Going to relax with some Cod WAW campaign
I love REI
same
doing good as well, shopping for hardware to mod (well was) nap time  prob right  now for me
i especially love that they now have used gear sections in their stores
That’s pretty cool
People use stuff once and return it lol
i mean there is definintly some broken stuff
(which is marked as broken)
or "damaged" is a better word actually
i got my current HR monitor there because basically someone wanted one of the garmin run ones and didn't realize that the polar whatever 10 doesn't do running dynamics i don't remember what the "this is why this was returned" tag said exactly, but it effectively was "this isn't a garmin run thing"
Hahaha
That’s unfortunate But now you got a 935 right?
i have a (checks....) 935, yeah - but this is my chest based hr monitor
that i use when i'm rowing and biking
becuase wrist based stuff just doesn't work for that
especialy rowing
i got my polar h10 for like, 40% off though
40% off is good yeah, my wahoo one was falling apart after like, 10 years or wahtever
(litterally falling apart, the strap was)  so i was in the market for a new one
How’s it been working out for you so far? Do you like using the one your got?
it's great
connects to all the thing and is accurate
Great, just finished an assignment due today
That’s good to see Good job today
nice
Hello to all a question so I am now starting lesson 3 on genki and I tought was going to have a small explanation of kanji but now I would like to know for me to study kanji in 2023 wich is best is still the book of remember the kanji or wanikani or even another source I started using kanji garden in the meanwhile?
you have to find what works for you
there is no "best"
its all pref, so try and see, look at <#746332929361182801>  or google for methods
Ah ok got it yes I had a look at them but was just wondering wich was best to teach them including the writting of them
as per my message above, there is no "best"
its what works for you
WK doesnt teach to write but tofugu has a guide
Genki has the back of the book
there are various books that teach you how to write them, as well as a handful of apps
^
im sure there are tons of reddit posts with details of each app
it'd be worth it for you to search so you can get a better idea of the landscape and what you might like
Once you learn how to write the stroke order of the radicals, understanding stroke order for any individual character gets to become second nature
I still can't believe in my first ever class, my teacher didn't teach us stroke order for hiragana, katakana, kanji. Writing Japanese got easier after I learned stroke order.
the tofugu article is gold
you can guess like 95% of the order of any kanji
I still think my first Japanese teacher didn't actually know any Japanese. I was at a small, private high school temporarily. I suspect she was asked to teach the class because she visited Japan once.
we 100% learned stroke order when i took japanese however many years ago that was
ahhhhh stroke order
hard to get at first, but once you get it, it stays with you forever!
you got this!!!
also good morning all
Legit think I could cry man I thought listening was a guarantee I was going to fail this thing, I am so shocked i managed to get a passing score for it…
congrats!!!!
Congrats to everyone who passed
Thank you, and for sure, major congrats to everybody else who passed!
Didn't Andy also take the test too?
I might be thinking of a different person Andy Wrote the N1
ohhhh, thats so hard. hoping for the best~
I'm not really active in the server but I just wanted to share my N5 resultscongrats but I woudl repost without your exam number
since this can be back tracked
ooops my bad
jsut trying to keep ya safe
Thanks for that!
how'd ya do!?

I didn't practice listening enough and honestly thought I was going to fail the listening section
my issue was the grammar sections =[ lol
I know what to study for next time. was a good warm uip
Congrats!
That’s gonna be me too for a different type of test :(
Only just recently found out what works for me for grammar
i need to check that
cause I work about 50-60 hours a week sometimes
and study part time
I get my languages confused sometimes as well so that doesnt help
Ahhh, i do that too
was a perfect gauge for the since ive also been out of school as well
what else do you speak?
Mandarin to a degree. Used it at home, but if you ask me give you a deep in thought lecture, I can’t nice
I have 3 native ones,
Reading is a pain, i mix the two sometimes. Ohh!!
What ones?!
We never spoke much, but I think you speak Greek?
Someone said something about Greek, was it you? haha
English, French, and Greek being my mother tongue
Most immigrant kids where I live speak 3 like me as a minimum
Ahhh, how lucky they are. I think its really important for people to at least speak 1 other language.
I agree, as a min, my grand father spoke 7
fluently, and 2 mother tongue
english, french, hebrew, Italian, Portuguese -> and the mother tongue was  greek, arabic
Wow!~ I hear of very few real polyglot's today. He must have been an inspiration
Egyptian Arabic! really nice
I think once you speak more than 3 does that count as a polyglot?
Yeah, its 3.
even with my wife, She speaks, English French and Polish, learned spanish and now Greek (im learning polish)
wanna sign up to my 6 week course lol
i kid haha
lol
Polish
has a lot of hard pronunciation, ah?
yeah she's from poland
it hard
i find Japanese easier
to be far, she cant get all the greek pronunciations, but she mimics me now
so some things she sounds like a local, the other she sounds like a forced italian accent ahah
it's more common than you think
hard to trill the tongue when your not use to it!
but most people don't share their lives on the internet
(as is reasonable)
mimicking is a really good practice. exactly like shadowing!
ahhh, sadly there was never one as cool as that in the community around me
Good to hear its more common, then!
consider that some statistics say than nearly half of the global population speak at least 2 languages
(and others say over half of the world's population, i think that stat is in a chapter writen by kees de bot in one of the intro to bilingualism texts published by routlidge)
That would make sense! There's a lot of dialects and official languages out there~
i don't know that most of those stats take into consideration dialects as they're based on national census data (i'm assuming) and those tend not to do so
ahhhh, what a shame~
politics
alas
:(
i know in Greece  most the younger population speaks a min of 2
also think liek 90% of montreal is bilingual even if some dont show it
i think something like 24% of people speak a language other than english in the home in the US
thats big
which obviously only accounts for a fraction of people in the US who are bilingual
Isn't most of Europe bilingual- I mean, they kind of have to be, considering how many countries are in a single region(?)
21.7% is the stat
(for the US and lang other than english in the home)
though i'm sure the percentage is undercounted due to the census being undercounted in general
Been waiting on Andy's results I want to make a flash card for two words here:

Ooh, you're moving fast. How long do you usually take on each lesson?
It depends on teh lesson, sometimes I spend more time and other times I spend less. In total I will spend around 6 months on Genki 1. But also remember, this isnt my first time studying Japanese, I originally took 2 years of Japanese.
Ah I see. For me genki 1 took a long time before I found Andy's channel. I was doing a lesson every month or so lol. After that it was smooth sailing. I finished genki 1 during the summer, genki 2 for some reason is taking me longer
How far into Genki 2 are you?
Hey. I've decided to lurk here as I slowly march my way through Genki 1
I'm on lesson 14 at the moment. About to go into lesson 15
Be careful, I am catching up lol
lol, it's why I noticed, I think I read a while ago you were in lesson 6 or 7 and now suddenly it's 12 haha
Only on 2 myself, just working through the extra content on the site after finishing the chapter in the book like a day or two ago.
All about my ko-,so-,a-,do-'s now
Nice! Keep it up! I think the first few chapters are some of the hardest, it then gets better
Though it does go back to being hard at some point lol
Its always good to go at your own pave. You are doing great and keep at it.
I think I was in lesson 6 around marchish
I wrote a video about pitch-accent and peoples are gonna be so mad. lol
English or Japanese? <:MomoNo:1067175025079238707>
its in English lol
Yeah, DM me. I'll be busy with work for a few hours though
thanks, and no worries
I do suggest grammarly and the office 365 editor, they added a thing where it suggests based of type
I'm slowly being sucked into the anime realm I wish anime was less annoying to consume in the states, it doesn’t help that I’m only interested in slice of life shows
wdym, its just are easy to get access to anything
between hidive, CR, netflix
you get pretty much anything you want
we are one of the easiest places to find stuff in NA, unlike europe who has differnt licenses based on countries especially germany
Apparently it's hard to get some japanese stuff with japanese subs.
Like you have to download the subtitles and they aren't even official.
I haven't looked into it too much because it sounded like so much work.
its cause they dont own the license for it
same can be said about english subs in Japan for anime
Disney plus has them, also made for netflix shows
if not you just pop a VPN netflix japan gets all teh shows
since sites like CR cant operate tere
simple problems have easy solutions
I’ve watched what I’ve seen on Netflix, I can look into crunchy roll but it seemed expensive for what it had when I looked last. I admit that was a long time ago though
CR is what stream 805 of the context
and hidive does all sendai things
for the price I pay, its not that much money given how much i use it
Can I use a VPN for crunchyroll, too?
to access japanese shows with japanese subs
CR doesnt work outside NA / EU
jsut mentioned CR has no JP subs
they do not hold the license
you can VPN to netflix japan
and they dont have EN subs only JP CC
Does netflix Japan hae everything on CR?
they are teh distributor in Japan, they should
Nord does
you just need to make sure that browser is closed then turn it on vpn
then open browser then go to the site
this is my `100% method so it works on netflix
Thanks, Phil.
np! any way to break localization hoarding im down
its a stupid greedy system
Komi Can't Communicate is my most recent anime. Pretty cute and lots of puns
I enjoyed that anime
Watching Spy Family right now. Anya is my favorite character of all time lol.
im watching about 20 of the new season
ive prob seen more anime than most anitubers lol
there are a few good ones this season
liek 
Hell's Paradise
My Love Story with Yamada-kun at Lv999
is My Love Story with Yamada-kun at Lv999 any good?
I havent seen it yet
I'm wanting to start Hell's Paradise. I accidentally started watching Cowboy Bebop again lol both are good, I really am enjoying Hell's Paradise
I'm also watching Dragon Maid. I try to keep it at 2 shows at a time. That one is fun.
