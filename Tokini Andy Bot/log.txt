Question: meals from a train station, are they supposed to be heated and eaten later or are they eaten on the train after being heated or are they eaten cold?
Currently at Kyoto Station waiting for the Shinkansen
really it depends on what they are selling, some foods are better hot but intentionally cold just to be more convenient for both the seller and customer
i’d say eaten on the train after being heated
thats just my experience though
Are you buying one of those train bentos?
the bentos were so good uwajimaya is a meer 10 minutes from the seattle amtrak station Sounds good. If there's a way to heat it up before you hop on the train, might be worth it.
Kinda already on it
Nice
mmmm
Not seeing any heating instruction
that sounds very good
